Template IBM Storage Storwize V3700

original template
https://github.com/gghuber/Zabbix-Template-IBM-Storage-Storwize-V3700


i did correct this template and translate it into " english" (google trad)

first you have to create two repository /etc/zabbix/scripts and /etc/zabbix/scripts/repo

then put all the scripts into /etc/zabbix/scripts  and modify the file "discovery"

!!! you have to install sshpass !!!

add the template and all will be ok !!
